# Password Manager Project Plan

## 1. Planning & Requirements

### Define Core Objectives and Key Features
- Outline essential security objectives and advanced features (e.g., 2FA, password strength meter, and MongoDB encryption).
- Research external APIs like Have I Been Pwned for dark web alerts.

### Technical Specifications & Security Plan
- Choose MongoDB for database needs, Tauri for the desktop app, and Rust for CLI.
- Define encryption protocols and secure connections (SSL/TLS).

## 2. Design

### UI/UX Design for the Desktop App
- Sketch wireframes for main screens (Dashboard, Password Vault, Settings).
- Design elements for Security Dashboard, password strength meter, and notifications.

### Database & Architecture Design
- Set up MongoDB schema with fields for passwords, secure notes, and other user data.
- Design communication between the CLI and desktop app with MongoDB.
- Outline data encryption and backup structures for security.

### Define System Interactions and User Flow
- Detail user flow for main functions: password management, 2FA, password checks, etc.
- Plan for secure data backup and restore workflows.

## 3. Development

### Core Security Implementation
- Configure MongoDB with encrypted connections (SSL/TLS).
- Implement at-rest and in-transit encryption for MongoDB data.
- Add 2FA (TOTP and hardware token) functionality.

### Core Password Management
- Build the password generator with customizable options (length, complexity).
- Implement password storage with weak password detection and health check alerts.

### CLI and App Integration
- Set up Rust CLI for core functions (e.g., add, retrieve, and update passwords).
- Enable communication between the CLI and desktop app.

### Advanced Security and Usability
- Add custom fields for storing additional sensitive data like PINs and security questions.
- Implement a Security Dashboard for quick security insights (e.g., weak passwords, latest health checks).
- Integrate in-app notifications for important security alerts and weak password updates.
- Set up login monitoring and dark web alerts using Have I Been Pwned API.

### Backup and Restore
- Implement encrypted local backups and user-configurable cloud backup options.

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Security Testing
- Conduct penetration testing to ensure MongoDB security and Tauri app vulnerabilities are resolved.
- Verify 2FA and backup features work as expected under various conditions.

### Feature Testing
- Test the functionality of the password generator, storage, and health checks.
- Validate UI elements for custom fields, password strength meter, and anti-screen capture functions.

### Cross-Platform Testing
- Test app performance on Linux, and Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## 5. Deployment

### Prepare App for Release
- Package the desktop app for various platforms and document the CLI tool.

### User Documentation
- Create a user guide with instructions on setup, features, and troubleshooting.

## 6. Maintenance & Future Enhancements

### Ongoing Updates
- Regularly update security patches and dependencies.
- Gather user feedback for potential feature enhancements and future updates.
